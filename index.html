            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The world of Assassins Creed seems to always be more densely populated with villains (templars) than allies (fellow assassins). Regardless of the time period you suddenly find yourself in one thing remains the same. You're a super sneaky assassin who must utilize his stealth along with whatever tools are at your disposal to unravel some far-fetched conspiracy and kill whomever the Templar is behind the plot. I find the fact that you are always outnumbered to be the most exciting aspect of the game. </p>
            <h2>Assassins</h2>
            <p>There have been 14 total games that have come out for multiple platforms (11 of them being console games). As you can imagine this has resulted in many protagonist assassins over the years. Here they are in order:</p>

                    <li>Ezio Auditore da Firenze</li>
                    <li>Ratonhnhaké:ton (Connor Kenway)</li>
                    <li class="feature">Edward Kenway(MY FAVORITE!)</li>
                    <li>Shay Patrick Cormac (an assassin turned templar)</li>
                    <li>Arno Dorian</li>
                    <li>Evie and Jacob Frye (twins)</li>

            <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
            <p>The assassin's arsenal has expanded considerably with each new edition. These upgrades range from poison darts to rope launchers even to different types of short-range bombs. Regardless of how many weapons are added or change one thing remains the same. The assassin's weapon of choice has always been the hidden blade. A hidden blade is a small knife stored on the underside of a wrist gauntlet which can be expelled either through hydraulics or by pulling a string or perhaps some more elaborate method. (There are quite a few theories on what exactly causes the blade to extend.) </p>
