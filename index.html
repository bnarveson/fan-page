            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The world of Assassin's Creed seems to always be more densely populated with villains (templars) than allies (fellow assassin's). Regardless of the time period you suddenly find yourself in one thing remains the same. You're a super sneaky assassin who must utilize his stealth along with whatever tools are at your disposal to unravel some far-fetched conspiracy and kill whomever the Templar is behind the plot. I find the fact that you are always outnumbered to be the most exciting aspect of the game. </p>
            <h2>Assassin's</h2>
            <p>There have been 14 total games that have come out for multiple platforms (11 of them being console games). As you can imagine this has resulted in many protagonist assassins over the years. Here they are in order:</p>

                <li>Ezio Auditore da Firenze</li>
